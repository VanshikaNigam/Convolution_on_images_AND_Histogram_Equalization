# Convolution_on_images_AND_Histogram_Equalization

1D and 2D Convolution on an image was performed using Sobel filters. This helped in detection of edges both horizontally and vertically ; first individually and later the conbined effect was also shown.
Histogram was plotted for the given image showing the count of each pixel between 0-255. Later an equalized Histogram was also plotted by calculating the cumulative frequency. Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast. 
Lastly with the help of histogram and tranformation function a near to original image was obtained.
