# Convolution_on_images_AND_Histogram_Equalization

1D and 2D Convolution on an image was performed using Sobel filters.
Sobel filter is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasizing edges. It computes gradient in x and y directions which helps in detection of edges both horizontally and vertically ; first individually and later the combined effect was also shown by calculating the magnitude.

Histogram was plotted for the given image showing the count of each pixel between 0-255. Later an equalized Histogram was also plotted by calculating the cumulative frequency. Histogram equalization is a technique for adjusting image intensities to enhance contrast. 
Lastly with the help of histogram and tranformation function a near to original image was obtained.
